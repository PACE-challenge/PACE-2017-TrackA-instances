# PACE 2017 competition instances

These instances were used in the The Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge.
The odd-numbered instances were made public before the challenge and the even-numbered instances remained hidden until the conclusion of the challenge.

[gr/exact/](gr/exact/) contains instances designed to be both challenging and interesting for programs that compute a tree decomposition of minimum width.

[gr/heuristic/](gr/heuristic/) contains instances selected to be both challenging and interesting for programs that heuristically compute a tree decomposition of small width.
