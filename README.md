# Treewidth challenge: PACE 2017 instances

These instances were used in The Second Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE 2017). Half of the instances were made public before the challenge and the other half remained hidden until the conclusion of the challenge. Details can be found in the [official PACE 2017 report](//dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.IPEC.2017.30).

[gr/exact/](gr/exact/) contains instances for the _exact_ treewidth challenge.

[gr/heuristic/](gr/heuristic/) contains much larger instances for the _heuristic_ treewidth challenge.

[td/exact/](td/exact/) contains optimal tree decompositions for the _exact_ instances.

- All of the _exact_ instances in this instance set are now considered easy. After the conclusion of the challenge, a significantly harder, [bonus instance set](//github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth-PACE-2017-bonus-instances) has been created.
- There is a [list of treewidth solvers, instances, and tools](//github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth), which also describes the .gr and .td formats.
